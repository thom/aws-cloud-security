Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload
data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor
practices as it relates to security. List these 2 practices, and a justification
for your choices, in the text file named E1T4.txt.

1. WebAppSG: Even though the Recipe Web Service is behind an Application Load
   Balancer, its security group permits ingress traffic from the internet to all
   ports (including 22, 5000 and 80) exposing the server to attacks. It also
   allows all egress traffic to any IP address.

2. AppLoadBalancerSG: The security group used by the Application Load Balancer
   is not forwarding port 80 (HTTP) to 443 (HTTPS).

3. RecipeWebServiceInstance: The Recipe Web Service Instance is placed behind an
   Application Load Balancer but still located in a public subnet.

4. S3BucketRecipesSecret: There is no encryption configured for the S3 bucket,
   allowing anyone with access to the account to read it.

5. InstanceRole, InstanceProfileRole and InstanceRolePolicy-C3: The IAM instance
   profile role used by the web service does not restrict the granted S3 actions
   and thus violates the least privilege principle.
