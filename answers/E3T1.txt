2. Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may
   have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?

- Amazon GuardDuty offers threat detection that enables to continuously monitor
  and protect AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3.
- GuardDuty analyzes continuous streams of meta-data generated from account and
  network activity found in AWS CloudTrail Events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS
  Logs. It also uses integrated threat intelligence such as known malicious IP
  addresses, anomaly detection, and machine learning to identify threats more
  accurately.
- In this case, GuardDuty detected the attack by scanning Amazon VPC Flow Logs
  for login attempts on port 22 (SSH).
