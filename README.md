#### Expected user flow:
- Clients will invoke a public-facing web service to pull free recipes.
- The web service is hosted by an HTTP load balancer listening on port 80.
- The web service is forwarding requests to the web application instance which listens on port 5000.
- The web application instance will, in turn, use the public-facing AWS API to pull recipe files from the S3 bucket hosting free recipes. An IAM role and policy will provide the web app instance permissions required to access objects in the S3 bucket.
- Another S3 bucket is used as a vault to store secret recipes; there are privileged users who would need access to this bucket. The web application server does not need access to this bucket.

#### Attack flow:
- Scripts simulating an attack will be run from a separate instance which is in an un-trusted subnet.
- The scripts will attempt to break into the web application instance using the public IP and attempt to access data in the secret recipe S3 bucket.
