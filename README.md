# Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Program - Project 3: Cloud Security - Protecting Resources and Data in the Cloud

## Exercise 1 - Deploy Project Environment

### Task 1: Review Architecture Diagram

![Starting architecture diagram](schematics/AWS-WebServiceDiagram-v1-insecure.png) _Starting architecture diagram_

#### Expected user flow:
- Clients will invoke a public-facing web service to pull free recipes.
- The web service is hosted by an HTTP load balancer listening on port 80.
- The web service is forwarding requests to the web application instance which
  listens on port 5000.
- The web application instance will, in turn, use the public-facing AWS API to
  pull recipe files from the S3 bucket hosting free recipes. An IAM role and
  policy will provide the web app instance permissions required to access
  objects in the S3 bucket.
- Another S3 bucket is used as a vault to store secret recipes; there are
  privileged users who would need access to this bucket. The web application
  server does not need access to this bucket.

#### Attack flow:
- Scripts simulating an attack will be run from a separate instance which is in
  an un-trusted subnet.
- The scripts will attempt to break into the web application instance using the
  public IP and attempt to access data in the secret recipe S3 bucket.

### Task 2: Review CloudFormation Template

#### VPC Stack for the underlying network:
- A VPC with 2 public subnets, one private subnet, and internet gateways etc for
  internet access
- See [c3-vpc.yml](cfn/c3-vpc.yml)

#### S3 bucket stack:
- 2 S3 buckets that will contain data objects for the application
- See [c3-s3.yml](cfn/c3-s3.yml)

#### Application stack:
- An EC2 instance that will act as an external attacker from which we will test
  the ability of our environment to handle threats
- An EC2 instance that will be running a simple web service
- Application LoadBalancer
- Security groups
- IAM role
- See [c3-app.yml](cfn/c3-app.yml)

### Task 3: Deployment of Initial Infrastructure

The objective is to deploy the CloudFormation stacks that will create the above
environment.
 
The AMIs specified in the CloudFormation template exist in the us-east-1 (N.
Virginia) region. It is necessary to set this as default region when deploying
resources for this project.

#### 1. Deploy the infrastructure

##### Deploy the S3 buckets
```
aws cloudformation create-stack --region us-east-1 --stack-name c3-s3 --template-body file://c3-s3.yml
```
 
Expected example output:
```
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:853001741663:stack/c3-s3/b60f3770-f46b-11ea-bc10-1221171ce649"
}
```

##### Deploy the VPC and Subnets
```
aws cloudformation create-stack --region us-east-1 --stack-name c3-vpc --template-body file://c3-vpc.yml
```
 
Expected example output:
```
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:853001741663:stack/c3-vpc/8ce78590-f46c-11ea-9b06-1214c28caebf"
}
```
 
##### Deploy the Application Stack 
Specify a pre-existing key-pair name:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --region us-east-1 --stack-name c3-app --template-body file://c3-app.yml --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPair,ParameterValue=<add key pair name> --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```
 
Expected example output:
```
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:853001741663:stack/c3-app/a0c7d760-f46f-11ea-acd6-0e3edd8361ed"
}
```
 
#### 2. Upload data to S3 buckets
Upload the free recipes to the free recipe S3 bucket:  
```
aws s3 cp free_recipe.txt s3://<BucketNameRecipesFree>/ --region us-east-1
```
 
Upload the secret recipes to the secret recipe S3 bucket:  
```
aws s3 cp secret_recipe.txt s3://<BucketNameRecipesSecret>/ --region us-east-1
```

#### 3. Test the application
Invoke the web service using the application load balancer URL:
`http://<ApplicationURL>/free_recipe`

### Task 4:  Identify Bad Practices

The architecture has several obvious poor practices as it relates to security:

#### 1. WebAppSG
Even though the Recipe Web Service is behind an Application Load Balancer, its
security group permits ingress traffic from the internet to all ports (including
22, 5000 and 80) exposing the server to attacks. It also allows all egress
traffic to any IP address.

#### 2. AppLoadBalancerSG:
The security group used by the Application Load Balancer is not forwarding port
80 (HTTP) to 443 (HTTPS).

#### 3. RecipeWebServiceInstance: The Recipe Web Service Instance is placed behind an
Application Load Balancer but still located in a public subnet.

#### 4. S3BucketRecipesSecret: 
There is no encryption configured for the S3 bucket, allowing anyone with access
to the account to read it.

#### 5. InstanceRole, InstanceProfileRole and InstanceRolePolicy-C3:
The IAM instance profile role used by the web service does not restrict the
granted S3 actions and thus violates the least privilege principle.

See [E1T4.txt](answers/E1T4.txt).

## Exercise 2: Enable Security Monitoring

### Task 1: Enable Security Monitoring using AWS Native Tools

Enable the following services:
- AWS Config
- AWS Security Hub
- AWS Inspector
- AWS Guard Duty

### Task 2: Identify and Triage Vulnerabilities

![AWS Security Hub showing compliance standards for CIS foundations](screenshots/E2T2_securityhub.png) _AWS Security Hub showing compliance standards for CIS foundations_

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities:
1. S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled: Enable S3 server-side
   encryption

2. The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic:
   Update default security group of every VPC to restrict all traffic

3. VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs: Enable VPC flow logging for
   all VPCs

4. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests
   to HTTPS: Reconfigure the Application Load Balancer to redirect all HTTP
   requests to HTTPS

5. Attached EBS volumes should be encrypted at-rest: Enable EBS server-side
   encryption 

See [E2T2.txt](answers/E2T2.txt).

## Exercise 3 - Attack Simulation

Now you will run scripts that will simulate the following attack conditions:
- Making an SSH connection to the application server using brute force password
  cracking
- Capturing secret recipe files from the s3 bucket using stolen API keys
 
### Task 1: Brute force attack to exploit SSH ports facing the internet and an insecure configuration on the server
 
#### 1. Log in to the attack simulation server using your SSH key pair
```
ssh -i <your private key file> ubuntu@<AttackInstanceIP>
```

#### 2. Run the below commands to start a brute force attack against the application server
```
date
hydra -l ubuntu -P rockyou.txt ssh://<YourApplicationServerDnsNameHere>
```

Wait 10 - 15 minutes and check AWS Guard Duty.

#### 3. Results of the attack

##### Findings detected related to the brute force attack
- UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce (high severity): i-04860d213fe7ec075 is
  performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.45. Brute force attacks
  are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH
  password.
- UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce (low severity): 10.192.11.35 is
  performing SSH brute force attacks against i-05502c5d5acbce75c. Brute force
  attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the
  SSH password.

![Guard Duty findings specific to the attack](screenshots/E3T1_guardduty.png) _Guard Duty findings specific to the attack_
 
##### Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?

Amazon GuardDuty offers threat detection that enables to continuously monitor
and protect AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3.

GuardDuty analyzes continuous streams of meta-data generated from account and
network activity found in AWS CloudTrail Events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS
Logs. It also uses integrated threat intelligence such as known malicious IP
addresses, anomaly detection, and machine learning to identify threats more
accurately.

In this case, GuardDuty detected the attack by scanning Amazon VPC Flow Logs for
login attempts on port 22 (SSH).

See [E3T1.txt](answers/E3T1.txt).
 
### Task 2: Accessing Secret Recipe Data File from S3
 
Imagine a scenario where API keys used by the application server to read data
from S3 were discovered and stolen by the brute force attack. This provides the
attack instance the same API privileges as the application instance. 

Test this scenario by attempting to use the API to read data from the secrets S3
bucket.
 
#### 1. Run the following API calls to view and download files from the secret recipes S3 bucket
 
```
# view the files in the secret recipes bucket
aws s3 ls s3://<BucketNameRecipesSecret>/ --region us-east-1
 
# download the files
aws s3 cp s3://<BucketNameRecipesSecret>/secret_recipe.txt  .  --region us-east-1

# view contents of the file
cat secret_recipe.txt
```
